# Credits

- Thanks to Rupali, our Product Owner, for her support in implementing and making Vibranium a common testing tool for all our projects.
- Thanks to my friend [Rahul](https://twitter.com/p_rahulbhargav) for his contributions in the initial phase of the project. The name Vibranium was coined by [Rahul](https://twitter.com/p_rahulbhargav) and myself.
- Thanks to the developers who have written the amazing npm modules, without which writing projects like these would have been almost impossible.
- Thanks to the amazing training content provided by [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com), [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com), [Youtube](https://youtube.com) and many others.
- [Github](http://github.com) for providing this amazing platform to share our projects
